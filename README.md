How to crawl through a website using Scrapy spiders

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Scrapy (http://scrapy.org/) is a powerful tool that will collect information across different webpages. Scrapy starts with one webpage and does a depth first search of all the links based on a set of rules. In this example, we'll start on rotten tomatoes home page, and we'll limit our crawling to the first 20 pages of a movie. 

The structure of their page looks like this:

<h3> Installing Scrapy </h3>

If you have pip (which I strongly recommend that you install for these tutorials), just type:

```
http://scrapy.org/
```

If things break in the middle of your installation, don't panic! You might need to install some basic dependencies (such as xcode).
